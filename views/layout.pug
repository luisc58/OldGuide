        p 
          | For many older people, home is everything. Itâ€™s a window to the past, a safe
          | haven for the present and the legacy they long to leave for the next generation.
          | The husband-and- wife founders of Old Guide have been helping seniors stay in
          | their homes, happily and safely. Now a nationally franchised but still family-run
          | business, Old Guide offers high-quality in-home care at affordable rates.
          | Our one-on- one services are provided when, where and how you want them.
          | They include companionship, meal preparation, hygiene assistance, medication
          | reminders, transportation and more.
